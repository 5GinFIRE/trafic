assumptions:
- downlink is 100Mbps with latency ~75ms
- (uplink is 50Mbps with latency ~92ms)

conventions:
- UDP flows on odd ports
- TCP flows on even ports

total test time:
- 60 seconds

traffic mix composition:
- 7% realtime media (7Mbps)
  - 8 audio streams (~64Kbps)
  - 8 video streams (~800Kbps)
    = total: 45.920154 MB [6.42 %]
- 10% scavenger / background (10Mbps)
  - application limited TCP flows - ideally, we should make them use LEDBAT
    = total 75.999288 MB [10.63 %]
- 25% high throughput TCP flow (25Mbps)
    = total: 96.118752 MB [13.45 %]
- 25% low-latency TCP flows (25Mbps)
  - average 1246KB page download (*)
    = total: 284.950824 MB [39.87 %]
- 33% ABR video (33Mbps)
  - 18 HD (960x720, H.264 + audio and subtitles) streams with 10s segments 1.8MB each)
    = total: 211.550928 MB [29.60 %]

= 714.539946 MB
